# Max4Live_various
Max/MSP patches to use within Ableton. To download - right-click on device name and choose "Save link as..." - worked last time at least.

- p_midi_filter - filter one desired midi-note.
- p_pedal_jammed - jams the sustain pedal so for plugins it will look like you pressed the pedal physically.
- p_preset_morpher - morph presets of parameters of the device from the left.
